Readme PRNL - PHP Raw Network Library
(c) 2009 Kenneth van Hooff & Martijn Bogaard

PHP Raw Network Library is a library to unclose the RAW network support of PHP. It's 
one of the less used feature's. Most people dont know HOW to use it, but it's very 
powerful. This library tries to make it usable for every decent PHP developer.

PRNL is written in PHP 5 OOP.

- Support

Support is given on a best effort basis. You can find us at #prnl @ irc.freenode.org. If you require 
commercial support, best effort doesn't fit your needs or you need priority fixing a bug, contact us to 
talk about the possibilities.

- License

PRNL is licensed under the GNU GPL v3.

- State

Currently this project is in the pre-alfa stage. The current code isn't mature enough to be 
used in production. The API's change almost on a daily basis and a lot of feature's are still missing.

- Requirements

* Unix like OS
* PHP 5.0+

- Supported

Other configurations *might* work but we can't ensure it. You can always file a bugreport 
for it, but such issues will only resolved if we have time for it. Patches are always welcome, as
long as they don't break the supported configurations.

* Linux 32 bit
* PHP 5.2

note: 64 bit *should* work but we haven't had the possibility to test it.

- Supported Protocols

* IPv4
* UDP
* TCP

- Unsupported Procols

* IPv6

note: checks are missing, data types aren't the right size etc. Small chance it will work.

- Known limitations

* PRNL require's root priveleges to open a raw socket. This is for security reasons and enforced 
by the linux kernel and isnt PRNL related.
* CentOS has a default SELinux configuration wich doenst allow Raw Socket usage and IP Spoofing.
Disable SELinux and PRNL will works fine.
