(c) 2009 Kenneth van Hooff & Martijn Bogaard

PHP Raw Network Library is a library to unclose the RAW network support of PHP. It's 
one of the less used feature's. Most people dont know HOW to use it, but its very 
powerfull. This library try to make it usable for every decent PHP developer.

- State

Currently is this project in pre-alfa stage. The current code isnt mature enough to be 
production ready, the API's change almost daily and a lot of feature's are still missing.

- Requirements

* Unix like OS
* PHP 5.0+

- Supported

Other configurations *might* work but we cant ensure it. You can always fill a bugreport 
for it, but they are only fixed if we have time to do it. Patches are always welcome, as
long they dont break the supported configurations.

* Linux 32 bit
* PHP 5.2

note: 64 bit *should* work but we havent the possibility to test it.

- Supported Protocols

* IPv4
* UDP
* TCP

- Unsupported Procols

* IPv6

note: checks are missing, data types arent on the right size etc. Small chance it will work.
