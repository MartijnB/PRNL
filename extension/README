This folder contains the native PRNL PHP Extension. This subproject was started to improve
the performance of PRNL. PHC (phpcompiler.org) was used to create the native extensions.
Sadly enough the performance of the native version was less then the script version.

Pure PHP:

$ time php bench/memory.php
real    0m16.694s
user    0m16.269s
sys     0m0.316s

Native tools:

$ time php bench/memory.php
real    0m17.931s
user    0m17.469s
sys     0m0.368s

As long this isnt fixed, a native version isnt usefull.
